# CodeGate

**AI-Powered Pull Request Quality Intelligence Platform**

CodeGate is a comprehensive Pull Request Quality Intelligence Platform that analyzes Pull Requests using AI-assisted review, static analysis, test evidence, and changed-code coverage. It provides explainable Quality and Risk Scores, Merge Policy evaluation, reviewer recommendations, and an engineering analytics dashboard.

*If you are reviewing this project for a defense or presentation, please start here: [**Final Defense & Documentation Index**](docs/README.md).*

## What CodeGate Does

When a developer opens or updates a Pull Request:
1. **GitHub PR** triggers an event.
2. **GitHub Webhook** is received by CodeGate.
3. **Async Analysis** is enqueued and processed by Celery Workers.
4. **AI Review** evaluates the code changes for bugs, security, and quality issues.
5. **Static Analysis** scans the AST for deterministic flaws.
6. **Tests/Coverage** are evaluated via a safe execution sandbox.
7. **Quality Score & Risk Score** are computed based on findings.
8. **Policy** is evaluated (PASS, WARNING, BLOCK).
9. **Reviewer Recommendation** suggests the best engineers to review the PR.
10. **GitHub Check** is published back to the PR with the results.
11. **Dashboard** visualizes the data and provides engineering analytics.

## Core Features

- **Automated Code Review:** Deterministic static analysis combined with probabilistic AI insights.
- **Quality & Risk Scoring:** Explainable scores mapped to your team's quality gates.
- **Merge Policy Engine:** Blocks, warns, or passes based on strict, configurable evidence.
- **Reviewer Recommendations:** Smart suggestions based on CODEOWNERS, file history, and directory expertise.
- **Full Analytics Dashboard:** React/Vite SPA for exploring PR quality trends and tenant data.
- **Secure Sandbox Testing:** Docker-based execution of repository test suites.
